## Overview

As a landlord, I want a way to see all my past and current contracts with tenants. I wanted it to be easily readable and accessible by logging in with a username and password. It should be usable by other landlords just like me. It should display tenant information in a table.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Landlords can use this page by entering a username and password. After logging in, they will be taken to the Tenant Trackr page, where they can see both their expired and current leases. To enter information on a new lease, use the button in the hamburger to enter their data into the form prompt. After submitting, this data will display in the table below.

Both the landing page and the tenant page are equipped with dark mode functionality. Each page has a dark/light mode toggle button within the hamburger in the upper right hand corner.
